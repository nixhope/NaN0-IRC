NaN0 IRC ChangeLog:

Latest:

0.3.0a
Rudimentary multi-channel support added. Now uses buttons to swap between channels.
No more "/w #channel message", now just type straight into the chatbox for the relevant channel.
Also fixed a couple of other things, like previous message scrolling should be smoother.

Known issues:
Still need to remove channels if you leave or get kicked.
Might be a problem with differentiating between upper/lower case letters in channel names. Alternatively, this might actually be fine.

Historical:

0.2.5c
Icon changed.
/TOPIC command added

0.2.5b
Began initial work on populating the Users textbox. Only need a way to change active channel now.
Fixed some /commands.
Added resizing.
Adjusted visibility of tray icon.
Hopefully fixed an issue with NOTICEs not displaying.
