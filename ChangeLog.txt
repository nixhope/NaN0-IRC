NaN0 IRC ChangeLog:

Latest:
0.3.1b
Multi-channel join on startup added. Simply separate with a semicolon or a comma, e.g. "#channel1, #channel2" or "#c1 ;#c2"
Basic tab completion of nicknames.

0.3.1a
Disconnect/reconnect handling hopefully improved slightly. Still needs work as it currently does not auto-reconnect.
Reconnecting seems to fail sometimes.

0.3.0b
Topic now changes when channel is changed.
/slash commands are now assumed to be directed at the current channel.
Rudimentary support for the /mode command.

0.3.0a
Rudimentary multi-channel support added. Now uses buttons to swap between channels.
No more "/w #channel message", now just type straight into the chatbox for the relevant channel.
Also fixed a couple of other things, e.g. previous message scrolling (using up arrow at text input) should be smoother.

Known issues:
Still need to remove channels if you leave or get kicked.
Problem with differentiating between upper/lower case letters in channel names. Since channel names are generally lower case, more of a problem when messaging users.
RichTextChat doesn't scale properly, if you adjust the height the last line is partially covered.
Non-ASCII characters can sometimes force a font-change in RichTextChat.

Planned improvements:
Auto-reconnect upon disconnection.
Focus to inputText after changing channel.
Tab completion cycling.
Interaction with usernames.
Options/settings/preferences menu.
New chat notification. Both while minimised (icon change) and maximised (channel button change).
New chat highlighting since currentChannel last gained focus, and other channels last were active.
Close channel buttons when quitting a channel, and quit/close channel by right-clicking on its button.


Historical:

0.2.5c
Icon changed.
/TOPIC command added

0.2.5b
Began initial work on populating the Users textbox. Only need a way to change active channel now.
Fixed some /commands.
Added resizing.
Adjusted visibility of tray icon.
Hopefully fixed an issue with NOTICEs not displaying.


Redesign ideas:
break into the following classes:
NaN0IRC
-keyboard input
irc
-channels
-users

Have currentChannel be an Object in the list of channels
