NaN0 IRC ChangeLog:

Latest:
0.3.0b
Topic now changes when channel is changed.
And a few other things changed as well.

0.3.0a
Rudimentary multi-channel support added. Now uses buttons to swap between channels.
No more "/w #channel message", now just type straight into the chatbox for the relevant channel.
Also fixed a couple of other things, e.g. previous message scrolling (using up arrow at text input) should be smoother.

Known issues:
Still need to remove channels if you leave or get kicked.
Problem with differentiating between upper/lower case letters in channel names. Since channel names are generally lower case, more of a problem when messaging users.
RichTextChat doesn't scale properly, if you adjust the height the last line is partially covered.
Slash commands need to be made relevant to the currentChannel.

Planned improvements:
Focus to inputText after changing channel.
Tab completion.
Interaction with usernames.
Options/settings/preferences menu.
New chat notification. Both while minimised (icon change) and maximised (channel button change).
New chat highlighting since currentChannel last gained focus, and other channels last were active.


Historical:

0.2.5c
Icon changed.
/TOPIC command added

0.2.5b
Began initial work on populating the Users textbox. Only need a way to change active channel now.
Fixed some /commands.
Added resizing.
Adjusted visibility of tray icon.
Hopefully fixed an issue with NOTICEs not displaying.
